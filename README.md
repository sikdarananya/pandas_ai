Beyond querying, PandasAI offers functionalities to visualize data through graphs, cleanse datasets by addressing missing values, and enhance data quality through feature generation, making it a comprehensive tool for data scientists and analysts.

​
# Features
Natural language querying: Ask questions to your data in natural language.
Data visualization: Generate graphs and charts to visualize your data.
Data cleansing: Cleanse datasets by addressing missing values.
Feature generation: Enhance data quality through feature generation.
Data connectors: Connect to various data sources like CSV, XLSX, PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Databrick, Snowflake, etc.

# How does PandasAI work?
PandasAI uses a generative AI model to understand and interpret natural language queries and translate them into python code and SQL queries. It then uses the code to interact with the data and return the results to the user.

​
# Who should use PandasAI?
PandasAI is designed for data scientists, analysts, and engineers who want to interact with their data in a more natural way. It is particularly useful for those who are not familiar with SQL or Python or who want to save time and effort when working with data. It is also useful for those who are familiar with SQL and Python, as it allows them to ask questions to their data without having to write any complex code.
